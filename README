Building

This software is builded by Scons software construction tool -
http://www.scons.org/

Scons building

run: scons [options] [install]

for building/installing the library and header file. Unlike Autotools
you must add build-time configure options to install target also.

Build time configuration

At build time you can configure locking subsystem. There are
two lock configuration options.

Note: 
     Scons do not uses leading -- before option names.
     Example: scons with-lockprefix=/tmp/.FSPL install

with-lockprefix=path
      Set lock prefix path to (default /tmp/.FSPL). Most users do not
      need to change it.
      
with-locking=none/semop/lockf
      Configure type of locking subsytem used. FSP library support currently
      3 types of locking subsystem.
         none  - no locking used
	 lockf - use lockf on lock file
         semop - use Sys V shared memory and semaphore. Lock file will be
	           still created because of use of ftok, but no locking is
		   done on this file -> it can be on shared filesystem.

prefix=/path
      Where to install builded library and header file. Standard option.

enable-maintainer-mode=yes
      Compile with more debug code inside

enable-shared=yes
      Build and install shared version of fsplib
